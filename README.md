# WIth Midnight Pre-Patch or Launch (whichever causes the addon break) my version of SUF will no longer work and will no longer be updated. Maybe things will change, but until then. It's where I will end my fixes

***NOT AN OFFICIAL SUF UPDATE***

***This will 100% be removed at the request of the original addon author(s)***

This is **ONLY** for TWW

I take no credit in the creation/updates to SUF, this is just a fan fix for SUF
